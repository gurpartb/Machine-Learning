#Data Preprocessing

# Importing the dataset
dataset = read.csv('Data.csv')
# dataset = dataset[, 2:3]

# Splitting the dataset into the Training set and Test set
# install.packages('caTools')

set.seed(123)
# not as simple as python, we have to prepare the method called split
split = sample.split(dataset$Purchased, Split = 0.8)

# Feature Scaling
# training_set[,2:3] = scale(training_set[,2:3])
# test_set[,2:3] = scale(test_set[,2:3])
