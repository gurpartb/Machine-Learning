I subscribed to a course on Machine Learning, from Udemy, on December 2018. Files and templates in this repo were provided as part of the course. I added these file on Github for personal use and to log my activity.  Anyone interested in these files should search subscribe for the course from the original author. I found the course to be very helpful and worthwhile investment of my time and money.

Thanks!
